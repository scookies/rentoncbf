      "The Renton Children's Business Fair was born from a simple belief: every child has the potential to be an entrepreneur. We create safe, supportive environments where young minds can explore business concepts, develop leadership skills, and build confidence through real-world experience.",
      "Our one-day markets aren't just events – they're launching pads for dreams. We've watched shy children transform into confident business owners, seen creative ideas bloom into sustainable ventures, and witnessed the spark of innovation ignite in young hearts."

        "description": "After watching my kids grow through other Children's Business Fairs in Washington, I saw how much they learned each time. But most fairs only happened in summer — and we wanted that spark to continue all year long. So we stepped up to create more opportunities for young entrepreneurs to learn, grow, and shine — no matter the season. 🌟"
